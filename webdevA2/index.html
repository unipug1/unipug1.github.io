                        <h3>What is bowling?</h3>
                        <p>Bowling is a sport and recreational activity where a player rolls a heavy ball down a lane to
                            knock down a set of pins. The standard and most popular form is 10-pin bowling, which uses
                            10 pins arranged in a triangle at the end of the lane.</p>

                        <p>Bowling dates back over 5000 years, with origins traced to Ancient Egypt. The modern version
                            of 10-pin bowling became popular in the United States in the late 19th century. Today,
                            bowling is both a casual hobby and a professional sport with leagues, tournaments and
                            televised championships.</p>
                        <p>Fun fact: Despite its long history, bowling has not been officially included as a medal sport
                            in the Olympic Games.</p>

                        <h3>Rules:</h3>
                        <p>The rules of 10-pin bowling are governed by the International Bowling Federation (IBF).</p>
                        <p>Here are the main rules:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>A standard game has 10 frames. In each frame, you get 2 chances to knock down the pins.
                                The objective is to knock down as many of the 10 pins as possible using a bowling ball.
                            </li>
                            <li>If you knock down all 10 pins on the first roll, it is called a strike and the frame
                                ends with just one roll.</li>
                            <li>If all 10 pins are knocked down using both rolls in a frame, it is called a spare. You
                                receive bonus points equal to the number of pins knocked down in the next roll.</li>
                            <li>In the 10th and last frame, if you get a strike or a spare, you are awarded 1 or 2 more
                                extra rolls to complete scoring.</li>
                            <li>If you cross the foul line while delivering the ball, it is considered a foul and no
                                points are awarded for that roll.</li>
                            <li>If the ball goes into the gutter or leaves the lane, no pins knocked down during that
                                roll are counted.</li>
                        </ol>

            <h2>Scoring</h2>
            <article class="scoring">

                    <div class="scoring-text">
                        <h3>How scoring works:</h3>
                        <p>Scoring in bowling can be complex, but here are the basics:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A strike is worth 10 points plus the total of your next two rolls.</li>
                            <li>A spare is worth 10 points plus the total of your next roll.</li>
                            <li>If you fail to knock down all 10 pins, you simply add up the number of pins you knocked
                                down. This is called an "open frame".</li>
                            <li>The maximum score for a single game of bowling is 300, which is achieved by rolling 12
                                consecutive strikes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Example: If you roll a strike in frame 1, and then roll 4 and 5 in frame 2, you get 10 + 4 +
                            5 = 19 points in frame 1.</p>
                    </div>

                <div class="accordion-text">
                    <p>There are many shot types. Some of them are:</p>

                            <h4>Straight Shot</h4>
                            <div class="accordion-content">
                                <p>The straight shot is the most basic type of shot in bowling. The bowler rolls the
                                    ball straight down the lane without any spin. This shot is ideal for beginners as it
                                    is easier to control and aim.</p>

                            <h4>Hook Shot</h4>
                            <div class="accordion-content">
                                <p>The hook shot is a more advanced technique where the bowler applies spin to the ball,
                                    causing it to curve as it rolls down the lane. This shot can help increase accuracy
                                    and pin action, making it a popular choice among experienced bowlers.</p>

                                <p>The backup shot is a technique where the bowler rolls the ball with reverse spin,
                                    causing it to curve in the opposite direction of a hook shot. This shot can be
                                    useful for hitting specific pin combinations or for making adjustments during a
                                    game.</p>

                <h3>Delivery Styles</h3>
                <div class="accordion-text">
                    <p>There are several delivery styles in bowling, each affecting ball speed, spin and hook potential.

                            <h4>Stroker</h4>
                            <div class="accordion-content">
                                <p>The stroker delivery style is characterised by a smooth, classic form with minimal
                                    shoulder rotation. This style is often used by bowlers who focus on accuracy and
                                    repeatability rather than power. This style is ideal for consistent scoring and
                                    spare pickups.</p>

                            <div class="accordion-content">
                                <p>The cranker delivery style is known for its high energy and explosive movement,
                                    involving heavy wrist action, open shoulders and a high backswing. This style is
                                    often used by bowlers who want to maximize their hook potential and create more pin
                                    action.</p>

                                <p>The tweener delivery style is a hybrid of the stroker and cranker styles, combining
                                    elements of both to create a versatile approach. This style allows bowlers to adjust
                                    their technique based on lane conditions and personal preferences, making it a
                                    popular choice among competitive bowlers.</p>

                                <p>The two-handed delivery style involves using both hands to deliver the ball,
                                    providing increased control and revs. This style is often used by bowlers who want
                                    to generate a high hook potential and is becoming increasingly popular in
                                    professional bowling. This style was widely popularised by Jason Belmonte.</p>

                            <div class="accordion-content">
                                <p>The no-thumb delivery style involves the bowler removing their thumb from the ball
                                    during the release, allowing for increased revs and a more significant hook. This
                                    style requires a high level of skill and control, as it can be challenging to
                                    master. This style is commonly used by advanced one-handed players like Tom
                                    Daugherty.</p>

                                <p>The spinner style is a unique delivery technique where the bowler rolls the ball with
                                    a high amount of spin, causing it to rotate rapidly as it travels down the lane.
                                    This style is often used for specific shot types, such as the backup shot, and can
                                    be effective in certain situations.</p>

                                <p>The conventional grip is the most common grip used in bowling, where the bowler
                                    inserts their fingers into the holes of the ball and places their thumb in the thumb
                                    hole. This grip provides a secure hold on the ball and allows for a smooth release.
                                    This is commonly used among beginners and recreational bowlers.</p>

                                <p>The fingertip grip is a technique where the bowler's fingers are inserted into the
                                    ball's holes up to the first knuckle, while the thumb is fully inserted. This grip
                                    allows for increased revs and a more significant hook potential, making it a popular
                                    choice among more experienced bowlers.</p>

                        <p>Proper form is crucial for effective bowling. Here are some key elements of good bowling
                            form:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stable stance: Start balanced with the ball at the waist or chest height.</li>
                            <li>Smooth approach: Usually 4 or 5 steps leading to the foul line.</li>
                            <li>Controlled swing: Arm swings like a pendulum; timing is crucial.</li>
                            <li>Clean release: Let the ball roll off your fingers at the bottom of the swing.</li>
                            <li>Follow through: Arm should continue upward in the direction of your aim, helping with
                                accuracy and consistency.</li>
